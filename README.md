# 👋 Hey, I’m Davi Castaldini

🚀 Software Developer focused on **Front-end UI**, **Back-end systems**, **Automation** and **Applied AI**.  
I care about **how things work** and **how they look**.

---

## 🧩 What I actually build

- 🎨 **Well-crafted front-ends** (clean UI, real UX, no visual noise)
- ⚙️ **Back-ends that survive production**
- 🔄 **Automations with n8n** that replace manual work
- 🤖 **AI-powered flows** (agents, assistants, decision support)
- 📊 **Data-driven dashboards & internal tools**

No toy projects. Real usage.

---

## 🎨 Front-end / UI

- **Vue.js**
- UI-focused dashboards & admin panels
- Strong attention to:
  - visual hierarchy
  - spacing & typography
  - usability > decoration
  - consistency & flow

> Good UI reduces errors, support tickets and cognitive load.

## 🧠 Back-end

- **Laravel (PHP)**
  - APIs
  - CRMs
  - business rules
  - background jobs & queues
- **Python**
  - automation
  - data processing
  - AI integrations
  - scripts that glue systems together

---

## 🤖 Automation & AI

- **n8n** for workflow orchestration
- Webhooks & API integrations
- WhatsApp & system automations
- **LLMs / AI** used for:
  - internal assistants
  - process automation
  - intelligent routing & analysis
  - productivity, not hype

AI is a tool, not the product.

---

## 📊 Data

- **PostgreSQL**
- Real SQL (joins, filters, aggregations)
- Data modeling for:
  - operational dashboards
  - metrics
  - reports that people actually read

---

## 🧱 Infrastructure

- **Linux**
- **Docker / Docker Swarm**
- VPS hosting
- Environment control > magic platforms
- Logs, networks, volumes done properly

---

## 🧠 How I think about products

- UI is not aesthetic — it’s **performance**
- Automation is part of the product
- UX problems become operational problems
- Simplicity beats cleverness
- Production reality > theory

---

## 🧪 What you’ll find here

- Internal tools
- Automations
- Dashboards
- System glue code
- Product-oriented experiments

✨ *Build useful things.  
Make them intuitive.  
Automate the rest.*
